Welcome to Lingkai Kong (孔令恺)'s homepage! I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, advised by [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/).


My research focuses on developing *reliable* data-driven solutions for high-stakes decision-making scenarios. Specifically, I work on the following areas:

- Uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks [[ICML'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10546), [EMNLP'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11506), [NeurIPS'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03904), [AISTATS'24](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/kong24a/kong24a.pdf)].  
- Controllable generative models [[ICML'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08849),[NeurIPS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05954), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18012)].  
- Aligning learning with optimization for decision-making [[NeurIPS'22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13837), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05889)].


On the practical side, I am passionate about  interdisciplinary applications: Public health [[NeurIPS'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03904), [WWW'22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07438), [KDD'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07940)] and Scientific discovery [[ICML'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08849), [TMLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10060), [AISTATS'24](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/kong24a/kong24a.pdf)].
