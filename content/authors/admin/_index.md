Welcome to Lingkai Kong (孔令恺)'s homepage! I am a Ph.D student in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working with [Prof. Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/). 
I recieved my B.E. in [Information Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/) from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm). 


My research focuses on developing *reliable* and *trustworthy* data-driven solutions for high-stake decision-making scenarios. Specifically, I work on the following areas:

- Uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks [[ICML'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10546), [EMNLP'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11506), [NeurIPS'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03904)].  
- Controllable generation for decision-making [[ICML'23]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08849).  
- Aligning learning with optimization for decision-making [[NeurIPS'22]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13837)), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05889)].


On the practical side, I am passionate about  interdisciplinary applications: Public health [[NeurIPS'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03904), [WWW'22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07438), [KDD'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07940)], Scientific discovery [[ICML'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08849), [NeurIPS-AI4Science'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10060)] and Natural Language Processing [[KDD'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19395), [NAACL'22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08787), [NeurIPS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16653)]
