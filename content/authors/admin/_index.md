Welcome to Lingkai Kong (孔令恺)'s homepage! I am a Ph.D student in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working with [Prof. Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/). 
I recieved my B.E. in [Information Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/) from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm).

My research spans across machine learning, natural language processing and data mining. 
I am particularly interested in making *trustworthy* intelligent system in *open-world* settings. 
Toward this goal, I am currently working on the following research thrusts:
-    Uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection in deep learning;
-    Out-of-distribution generalization and zero shot learning;
-    Application of uncertainty-aware deep learning in natural language processing and healthcare.
